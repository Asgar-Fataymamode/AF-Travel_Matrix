# üõ´ AF Travel Matrix

This repository contains both the **Angular frontend** and **ASP.NET backend** of the AF Travel Matrix application, developed to manage and track travel arrangements for companies with multiple branches.
This was completed during my Summer 2024 Internship at SD Worx.

## üìÇ Project Structure

In organizations with **multiple branches and frequent travel**, it becomes challenging to:
- **Track employees** who are currently present, arriving, or traveling.
- **Schedule meetings** without knowing the availability of employees across branches.
- **Visualize travel schedules** easily.

AF Travel Matrix solves these challenges by:
1. **Providing real-time updates** on employee travel statuses.
2. Offering a **calendar view** to **schedule meetings** based on employee availability.
3. Storing **centralized travel data** in a database for easy management.
